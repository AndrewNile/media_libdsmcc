MEDIA_LIBDSMCC
==============
Fork of the project media_libdsmcc by Gregory Koch, who significantly reworked the libdsmcc library written by Richard Palmer.

This fork brings Windows (MinGW) compatibility to the library. It probably doesn't support pure MSVC due to the use of several POSIX functions (such as fileno()).

The flavour of MinGW I compiled this against is mxe. I have attempted to retain the original Linux code, its functionality has not been tested and I'd recommend you use the original library instead.


REQUIREMENTS
============
ZLib
mman wrapper for Windows (https://github.com/alitrack/mman-win32)


BUILDING
========
The following flags can be used with the configure script:
--enable-debug                       Enables verbose debug messages
--enable-ignore-private-indicator    Decodes sections marked as private

Please note that TMP_OVERWRITING is currently broken in Windows.


USAGE
=====
The tool dsmcc-reader can be used to work with .ts or .pid dumps captured from DVB cards.

dsmcc-reader <dump file.ts> <PID to decode in decimal> <output directory>
